        <h4 class="section-subheading adjustline">Do you know what is currently up in the ERP market? We rounded it up and made it easier for you to keep up-to-date.</h4>
        <div class="text-muted">
          <p>C-Suite and managers in financial services are confronted with growing challenges. To streamline operations and deliver the services technically proficient customers expect, decision makers need to keep an eye on the latest IT trends.</p>
          <p>Do you know what is currently up in the ERP market? Or how the 2017 IT trends change enterprise resource planning? We rounded it up and made it easier for you to keep up-to-date.</p>

      <h2 class="text-primary heavy-font padding-top-small">How big data changes ERP?</h2>
        <div class="text-muted">
          <p>ERP systems collect and organize a great deal of information about business processes and customer behavior. But collecting and organizing information is no longer enough: companies are expected to combine different data sources and improve reporting and analysis activities.</p>
          <p>Big data is becoming complementary to ERP systems as it helps to refine the inputs to software. The better the inputs, the more efficient enterprise resource planning installations run.</p>
        </div>
      <h2 class="text-primary heavy-font padding-top-small">An intelligent ERP</h2>
        <div class="text-muted">
          <p>An intelligent ERP uses new technologies such as artificial intelligence, predictive analytics, and cloud deployment. Intelligent ERPs are the next step in the evolution of the ever-changing IT landscape and will have a great impact on how companies plan, use and expand their resources.</p>
        </div>
      <h2 class="text-primary heavy-font padding-top-small">ERP goes mobile</h2>
        <div class="text-muted">
          <p>As sales managers and consultants began performing their activities away from the office, using tablets and smartphones, ERPs needed to evolve. Business software now ensures company and customer data are accessible from anywhere.</p>
          <p>In the case of <a href="/solutions/charisma/">Charisma</a>, mobile-ready technology updates company data in real time and allows access to the database via web services. Push notifications make sure users remain on top of their game and are aware of the latest changes.</p>
        </div>
      <h2 class="text-primary heavy-font padding-top-small">Cloud ERP</h2>
        <div class="text-muted">
          <p>More and more companies choose to use cloud-based punctual solutions for ERP and CRM systems. Bringing these systems to the cloud eliminates the need for hardware acquisition and maintenance, cuts deployment costs and allows companies scale their IT in fast and reliable ways.</p>
        </div>
      <h2 class="text-primary heavy-font padding-top-small">Can an ERP be social?</h2>
        <div class="text-muted">
          <p>Your employees are already using social media tools to get things done. The next step in ERP development will capitalize on those existing connections. Integrating social media into ERP will open up ways for employees to interact and be more productive.</p>
          <p>We expect social media integration will become more and more relevant, allowing organizations to add new elements to ERP applications, such as visitor profiles and conversation feedback.</p>
